              Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin,[1] in which a small amount of nearly boiling water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9–10 bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi) of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.             </div>

              A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,[1] but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating.</div>

              Molten chocolate cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a chocolate cake and a soufflé.[citation needed] Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center,[1] and it is also known as chocolate moelleux (from French for "soft"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake.[2] It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence melting on the palate.</div>

In 1923 Ugo Paolini, an Italian, filed patent documents relating to a tomato juice separator and he developed the idea of making a coffee pot with a press action and a filter.</div>
